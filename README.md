# personal portfolio & blog

this is the website iâ€™m building to house my portfolio & blog (thoughts, ideas, and more!)

itâ€™s built using **Flask** & will eventually include:
- my blog (moving all my relevant medium blogs here)
- collection of some of my projects to highlight my tech skills
- a contact form (probably best way to reach me moving forward)
- links to my socials!

this project is a way for me to practice backend development & database integration,
but also as a place to share what matters to me, my ideas, etc.

deployed version coming soon!
